Hi,

My name is Greg! I'm a generalist software engineer and tech lead. I'm currently working @VMware where I'm part of the team behind the VMware Tanzu platform. Before that I spent a few years at Unruly where I was a full stack dev.

Go, Java and Swift are my favourite languages.

When not at work I build iOS apps in Swift (and Objective-C). I also fiddle with Android development. You can find my work on both Apple Store and Google Play Store.
